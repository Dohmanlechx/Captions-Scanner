# Captions Scanner
A final degree project for my education. An Android application which makes your life easier in learning words!

## Idea
The user scans a word from captions on another screen and the application interprets the word instantly. Meanwhile it stores the word in app's in-built database. Therefore, the user can play a game where it asks you what those scanned words are meaning. In that case, the user is heavily improving his words skills if he is active.

Update 2018-11-09: I have changed my plans a bit after meeting limitations of the API. The new idea is that user scans whole captions. After that, user clicks on the word he wants to interpret. In this way it works better.

Update 2018-11-29: I am skipping the game idea. Since I feel it doesn't help the user in improving purposes when he already can get definitions etc from just clicking the word. Also, I can't work out how the game would work in practice, maybe just not yet.

## Functions
